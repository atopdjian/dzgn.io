What is a LOB you ask? It is a Low Opacity Box.  Low Opacity Boxes are used as overlays to provide feedback to the user of a hover interaction by adjusting the visual perception of the image. In our example we use a LOB to darken the image and add text to the hover effect for greater context of the object.
